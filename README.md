# On-Premises Data Privacy Solution

This project developed a comprehensive on-premises solution aimed at safeguarding data privacy for industry clients, particularly in environments involving student contributions to client projects and third-party AI tools. 

## Approach

- **Docker-in-Docker Isolation**: Utilized a Docker-in-Docker approach written in Go, allowing the hosting of multiple project workspace servers directly on the client’s main server.
- **Secure Access via Reverse Proxy**: Implemented credential-based authentication on a reverse proxy server to securely direct students to their designated workspace servers without compromising data integrity.
- **Automated Deployment Script**: Developed a deployment script to automatically configure Nginx settings and manage the seamless deployment of all services across the server.
- **AI Tools Integration**: Created and integrated three AI tools hosted on the client’s server:
  - **Documentation Simplifier**: Streamlines the complexity of technical documentation.
  - **dev2vec**: Enhances code understanding and categorization.
  - **Milestone Generator**: Automatically generates project milestones based on progress metrics.
